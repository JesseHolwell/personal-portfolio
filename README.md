# Jesse Holwell's Personal Site

Hey there! KL here. This is a v1 of my portfolio site, which is shamefully a template I edited to get something out there fast, and I plan to revist and rewrite. I wanted to practice some newer web technologies and also get my information out there to add credibility to my freelance services, so I thought why not start with my porfolio.

This is written in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), as a SSG tool. It utilizes [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as well as [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.

Site is Currently deployed with AWS Amplify.

## Local Development

This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use atleast Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS. There's a `.nvmrc`, you can run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed.

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm.

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```

or just

```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment

Nothing special, its setup on Amplify, just merge a feature branch to main and you're good.

## Credits

Made with Love and :coffee:
